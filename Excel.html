Additionally, understanding the factors contributing to the fluctuation in sales throughout the year, especially during peak months like April, can help in developing targeted marketing and sales strategies to capitalize on high-demand periods. Furthermore, building strong partnerships with retailers like Foot Locker, who have demonstrated success in selling Adidas products, can enhance brand visibility and sales performance.
